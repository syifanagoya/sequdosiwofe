It was easy to assemble and while there are lots of programs and interval training options available, you can also hit Just Row and start your workout. I like the adjustable foot pads and feet straps that keep you securely in place and the handle is comfortable to hold and you don’t lose grip even when you start getting sweaty. The built in data screen track distance, speed, calories and much more and has wheels on the front so it’s easy to move around. We’ve had ours for eight years and it still looks and works like a brand new machine despite getting a lot of use.”</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>SHOP HERE</a></b></i></p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Everfit Rowing Exercise Machine, $170.95 (down from $200.95) at Myer</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know</b></p><p>This compact rower can be folded away when not in use.
