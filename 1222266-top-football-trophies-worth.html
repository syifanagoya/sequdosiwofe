The rule was scrapped in the 2008-2009 season.

To start with, two brass hemispheres are combined using a blowtorch.</p><p class=align-left>The resulting sphere is then given to a carver who fills the insides with tar. He then uses a hammer and chisels to form the lines that resemble a football's seams. The tar is removed, and the 'ball' is taken to the goldsmith for polishing and engraving.</p><p class=align-left>At this point, the trophy is engraved with the FIFA Ballon d'Or logo and then put in molten gold. Lastly, it is polished into a nice-looking award presented to top footballers.</p><p class=align-left>While the true value of the Ballon d'Or is not quite known, it has been valued at £600,000 (about $805,439) ever since <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> sold his for that amount at a charity auction.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/47df9b4c26e20f74.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 famous people from Mexico who have made it big in the world</span></p></a><h3>4.
