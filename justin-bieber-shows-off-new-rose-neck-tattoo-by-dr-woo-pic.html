The “Yummy” singer then followed up with a quick video clip from the appointment, featuring the sound of a tattoo gun buzzing away in the background.</p><p>The intricate design has all kinds of beautiful details, from pointy thorns on the stem, to realistic folds in the flower petals to sharp lines in the leaves. Overall, it truly is a work of art.</p><p>It’s reported that Bieber has over 60 different tattoos, which includes another neck tat on the other side.

The 23-year-old model then followed suit and got a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tattoo</a> on her neck with the word “lover” written in cursive.</p><p>Besides neck tats, the “Sorry” singer also has a couple of tiny <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">face designs</a>, one of which is a cross near the corner of his eye. “It represents his journey in finding purpose with God,” the artist <a href=#>JonBoy </a>told Us Weekly back in May 2016.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though he’s clearly not afraid to go bold, that doesn’t mean he’s happy with all his design choices. Back in February 2016, he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> that there’s one tattoo in particular he had to alter. It was a portrait of his ex-girlfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a>. “This is my ex-girlfriend,” he told the publication. “I kinda tried to cover her face up with some shading, but people still know.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2FCtMDIp2SboZWXsrN50qGmsKtdpLOnec2ermaqn6iybrrEnKJmrJGpwbC7jJuwZpyiYsSwu4ypoJxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tfue-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Tfue Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating,Bio-Wiki</span></a>
