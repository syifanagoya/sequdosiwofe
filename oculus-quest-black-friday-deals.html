This Black Friday, the VR headset was down to its best-ever price in the UK and US, so if you've been looking to pick up the headset this is your best chance.</p><p>If the Oculus Quest 2 isn't quite what you're after, we'd highly recommend its successor, the Meta Quest 3 (which we gave five stars in our <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/hands-on-meta-quest-3-review>Meta Quest 3 review</a>). While the best deal to be found right now doesn't include a discount, you will get a free copy of Asgard's Wrath 2 with your purchase (though the game doesn't launch until December 15).</p><p>Want to know more about Meta's headsets? You can read through our <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oculus-quest-2-review>Oculus Quest 2 review</a> to get a feel for the headsets well as our <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/hands-on-meta-quest-3-review>Meta Quest 3 review</a> to see if the new best VR headset from Meta is a better pick for you.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-black-friday-quest-2-deals-quick-links-us><span>Black Friday Quest 2 deals - quick links (US)</span></h2><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-black-friday-quest-2-deals-quick-links-uk><span>Black Friday Quest 2 deals - quick links (UK)</span></h2><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-black-friday-oculus-quest-2-deals-faqs><span>Black Friday Oculus Quest 2 deals: FAQs</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg><h3>When did the best Black Friday Oculus Quest 2 deals start in 2023?</h3><p>Black Friday officially took place on November 24, but many retailers began their sales a lot sooner with ‘proper’ Black Friday sales arriving a few weeks ago. Now, all the deals are in full swing.&nbsp;</p><h3>Where are the best Oculus Quest 2 Black Friday deals?</h3><p>The best Oculus Quest 2 deals can be found here of course; all weekend, we’ll let you know about the deals we think are great and some Quest 2 deals you might be best to avoid. If you want to do your own deal hunting, here are the sites we’d recommend.</p><p><strong>US Oculus Quest 2 sales</strong></p><p><strong>UK Oculus Quest 2 sales</strong></p><h3>What Black Friday Oculus Quest 2 deals are we seeing in 2023?</h3><p>Last year for Black Friday, Meta offered a pretty good bundle deal that not only shaved money off the Quest 2 headset but gave you a fantastic VR game for free in Resident Evil 4 VR. This year we’re seeing something similar with Asgard's Wrath, though we’re not super sure what to expect across the weekend because the Quest 2 is in a very different place than it was in 2022.</p><p>Firstly the VR headset got a major price drop down to $299.99 / £299.99 for the 128GB version and $349.99 / £349.99 for the 256GB model earlier this year. This is the price it was before a major price hike in August 2022 and we’re not sure Meta will go much lower on it, because the headset is apparently already a loss leader.</p><p>Secondly, Meta now has the new Meta Quest 3. It’s only just launched and while new tech typically makes older generations go down in price Meta might not want to distract us from its shiny new gadget as we head into the all-important holiday season by offering an amazing Quest 2 deal.&nbsp;</p><p>So at best we expect the Quest 2 is also bundled with an accessory like the Elite Strap in some places,&nbsp;but won’t have a proper discount.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHCoamanJGne6S7zGiZpZmToHqnvsidmLJnn5jCrcHSZqiunaOpeqO4wJyiZp6inrGixYydnJqkow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angel-di-maria-bio-age-nationality-height-family-career-goals-club-salary-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>ngel Di Mara Bio, age, nationality, height, family, career goals, club, salary, net worth</span></a>
