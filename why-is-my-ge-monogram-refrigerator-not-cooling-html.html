Your refrigerator has been in use for more than a decade.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the location of the coils on a GE refrigerator?</h3><p>The condenser coils are positioned either beneath the refrigerator, behind the base grille, on the back of the refrigerator, or on the top of the refrigerator, depending on the model you have.</p><p></p><h3>What is causing my refrigerator to run but not to cool?</h3><p>Poor cooling may be caused by clogged coils. Check to see that nothing is trapped in the condenser fan and that it is free to spin (fans are not included in versions with coils on the back of the unit).

Connect the refrigerator to the power source and ensure that the fan is functioning while the compressor is operating.</p><p></p><h3>What is causing my refrigerator and freezer to be so warm?</h3><p>Refrigerator: Freezer isn’t cold enough, according to the manufacturer. Problems with the defrost system, filthy condenser coils, fan failures, leaking door gaskets, or control issues may all contribute to your freezer not getting as cold as it should.

A malfunctioning evaporator fan will result in insufficient cooling in either the freezer or the refrigerator. If the fan blade does not revolve freely, the fan motor should be replaced. In addition, if the motor is exceptionally loud, it should be replaced.</p><p></p><h3>What is causing my side-by-side refrigerator to not cool?</h3><p>The evaporator fan motor is responsible for circulating the cold air from the coils throughout the cabinet.
