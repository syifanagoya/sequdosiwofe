When flared pants started to come back into fashion again, we have to admit we felt a little iffy at first. We ditched them long ago for skinny jeans, and we’d been enjoying the more recent popularity of wide leg pants."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We ditched them long ago for skinny jeans, and we’d been enjoying the more recent popularity of wide leg pants. Did we really want to go back to wearing flares?</p><p>Then we started to see more and more of the new designs, and we realized they had not only leveled up since the early 2000s, but they fit in perfectly with some of the other pieces we love to wear right now. And so, we dove head first back into <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">flare world</a>, and we’ve had no regrets since. Things only keep getting better and better thanks to pairs like these!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><a href=# rel=nofollow class=shopping-button__link></a><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Floerns Velvet Elastic Waist Flare Leg Palazzo Pants</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$37</a> at Amazon!

They have flared legs, of course, and a high-rise waist. Our flared pants back in the day were all low-rise, but we love how the high-rise silhouette really helps to visually elongate the legs!</p><p>You’ll notice <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these pants</a> have no buttons, zippers, hooks or pockets. They’re streamlined for smooth sailing as the ribbing makes its way from the waist down to the hems. We adore the look, and we definitely don’t mind being able to slip them on and off more easily!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><a href=# rel=nofollow class=shopping-button__link></a><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Floerns Velvet Elastic Waist Flare Leg Palazzo Pants</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$37</a> at Amazon!
