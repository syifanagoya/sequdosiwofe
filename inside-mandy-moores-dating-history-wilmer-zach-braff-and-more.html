I don’t fault myself for it,” she shared. “When people said, ‘I’m sorry,’ I was like, ‘No. Sorry would have been had I stayed in a very unhealthy situation.’ I didn’t. I found my way out. And when I did, things opened back up again,” she said.</p><p>Moore told the outlet that she was “still dealing with the <a href=#>trauma of my divorce</a>” when she met Goldsmith in 2015. “Taylor was steadfast in his support — that was a huge sign for me.” The duo met via Instagram after Moore posted about her excitement for a new Dawes album on her Story.</p><p>“We have a modern kind of love story,” she told InStyle in March 2019. “If someone would have told me three years ago, ‘That’s your future husband, and you’re going to meet him through Instagram,’ I would have thought that they were absolutely bonkers. It proves that you have to stay open-minded because you just never know.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple welcomed their first child together, <a href=#>August “Gus” Harrison</a>, in February 2021.
