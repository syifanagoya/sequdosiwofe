I can’t say that I still find Jude Law attractive, at least not like I used to find him attractive. If I didn’t know about his past beauty, I would probably think he was a nice-looking guy with a wonky hairline, but you’ve got to understand… Jude’s former beauty was legendary. Like, heterosexual men would stop and comment on his beauty. He was more beautiful than most women.</p><p>But maybe Jude’s faded beauty is a good thing. Maybe now he will finally be recognized for his acting chops, which are not insignificant. Jude is an Oscar-nominated actor whose beauty forced him into a more traditional “leading man” status. Jude’s been fighting that leading man tag for years now, and I feel like he’s finally coming back to where he always wanted to be: a character actor, a shape-shifter, an ensemble player. A few weeks ago, Jude was at TIFF to promote his new film, Don Hemingway, and now we finally have a trailer. Be careful… you will be stunned by this version of Jude. (Note: the trailer is slightly <strong>NSFW</strong>, depending on how you feel about dude-butt).</p><p></p><p>I had to watch it twice to understand some of that dialogue. I’m just saying, the accents are very heavy. Jude is playing a criminal, a two-bit gangster who just got out of prison with his sense of humor intact. Demian Bichir plays his boss – how awesome is it that Demian keeps getting work in these bizarre little projects? Jude’s criminal partner is played by the underrated Richard E. Grant, who is another actor (like Jude) who often gets typecast as “posh” but who can do sleazy surprisingly well. And did you recognize the actress playing Jude’s daughter? That’s the Khaleesi!! That’s Emilia Clarke. Anyway, this looks like a surprisingly good and entertaining movie. It will be interesting to see if this is where Jude’s career goes from now.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wenn20688448.jpg alt title=wenn20688448 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wenn20688449.jpg alt title=wenn20688449 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wenn20688424.jpg alt title=wenn20688424 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wenn20688443.jpg alt title=wenn20688443 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbGpkan9ye8mum56XnJbEoLjOrKuYrJiarLG%2BxK2rspeXlravscOYqqillZSupMDIp56Ym5ikvbSr1qispZyPrry2q9KtoKWkj522tavIrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-ending-explained-release-date-cast-plot-summary-where-to-watch-and-more-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Killing of a Sacred Deer Ending Explained, Release Date, Cast, Plot, Summary, Where to Watch and</span></a>
