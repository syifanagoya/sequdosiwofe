He turned into a local celebrity thanks to starring in 1994 movie Nightwatch, but gained the international recognition after appearing on TV as Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones series. The latter drove the performer to nominations for Screen Actors Guild, Primetime Emmy, People’s Choice and Critics’ Choice Television awards. Moreover, Nikolaj appeared in many movies, including Black Hawk Down, The Other Woman, Gods of Egypt and Shot Caller. &nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Nikolaj Coster-Waldau prefers rather a low-key living and that’s why, there is not too much information about his closest relatives. But here are the main facts about his family.</p><p></p><h2>Nikolaj Coster-Waldau parents</h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Jorgen Oscar Fritzer Waldau</strong> (father)</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> September 24, 1939</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Death:</strong> 1998 (age 58)</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Libra</p><p style=text-align:justify>Suffering from alcoholism, Jorgen divorced with Nicolaj’s mother when the future star was a kid.
