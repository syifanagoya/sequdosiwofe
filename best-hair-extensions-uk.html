When done well, no one but you will know that your resplendent mane is care of copious hours in a salon. Used by many an A-list celebrity, they’re a <strong>hairstylist’s secret weapon for red carpet events</strong>. We’ve tried and tested the very best to bring you the best brands and salons in the business…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/522bcba7de33-gabriella-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ePv8k9Im-qN data-wc=6><strong>Beauty writer Gabriella Pisano trialled Goldfever</strong></p><p id=eT5aiB5pY81c data-wc=208><strong>Goldfever Hair</strong>Our beauty writer Gabriella recently trialled Goldfever, at the Hersheson salon in london. Fitted by Hair Extension extraordinaire Vicky Demetriou (the best), Goldfever uses a specialist Keratin bond that not only helps hair growth but is much smaller than other extension bonds secured in this way. They were super easy to style, and after three months all 200+ bonds were still in place, whilst the hair quality was the best we had tried.<strong>Vixen & Blush</strong>Our online editor Alex Light is a huge fan of Vixen & Blush. Light and virtually completely undetectable, the microbonds are perfect for fine and fair hair. What's more, the expert salon colour blend to ensure an incredibly natural fit. After almost a year of wearing the bonds, there has been zero damage to hair.<strong>Hair Rehab</strong>Founded by Lauren Pope (TOWIE) we first tested these as temporary clip-in extensions but now available in select salons as a more permanent solution and the hair quality is just as good. If you like big hair with lots of volume then these are for you - the bonds are wider than other brands we tested and we loved the full effect it gave to our locks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/830740c6a603-hairaa-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eC2GJi_Xv6Qp data-wc=10><strong>Our online editor's before and after visiting Vixen & Blush</strong></p><p id=eaq4MC5dxEoY data-wc=151><strong>Easilocks</strong>Secured by threading tiny rings through your own hair, slipping the extension through the bond and closing, our tester loved the subtlety of Easilocks. These bonds are quite hard, so instead of overloading the hair with as many bonds as possible, which can be uncomfortable, our tester wanted added thickness so only a few extensions were dotted throughout the hair. These lasted for months without any damage to the natural hair and was the fastest application method too - great for those who don’t have hours spare to sit in a salon.<strong>Kapello</strong>These clip-in extensions provide the quickest, and non-damaging route for thicker longer hair. As a temporary solution, and far less pricey, Kapello uses the same high quality hair but after an evening out, or party, you can just unclip these for a low commitment option. If you're suffering with post-extension removal blues, these are a great substitute for the interim!</p><p id=eSr6hM0jX8Rs data-wc=96><strong>Halo Hair Extensions</strong>Another temporary fix, but the most undetectable hair extensions we have ever tried. The Halo Piece, £99.99, is attached to an adjustable invisible wire that fits around your head. Once slotted in pace, it won't slip and the wire blends in with the rest of your hair. With no attachment to any of your own hair it's 100% damage-free, just make you spend the time adjusting this precisely to your individual head size and get a friend to help pulling all your own hair over the top of the wire to hide the line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGlpaWVmfXGBlG1uam5fl7K0wIyhmKKqXZrFtbHNrKCopqNiwqx7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-bynes-tweets-i-have-an-eating-disorder-201354.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Bynes Tweets: &amp;quot;I Have an Eating Disorder&amp;quot;</span></a>
