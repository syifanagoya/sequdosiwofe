Let’s be clear — regardless of how me and her argue or she argues with anybody else. She definitely can handle herself in an argument, let’s be clear. She had already told the world she was planning on reading us that day, so it wasn’t because she was arguing with us. As a matter of fact in the moment that she got up to walk away, we weren’t even talking to her anymore.’</p><p>‘So it wasn’t like anything that happened in that moment to make her get up and walk away. What had happened was that Yovanna had posted a video on social media to kind of let people know that she was about to come on. And NeNe was told by whoever was on her team, or whatever or she saw or whatever, and that’s what made her get up and walk away. She didn’t want to deal with her,’ the reality TV star went on to tell the news outlet.</p><p>Kandi also argued that she could not explain why NeNe did not want to deal with her since she isn’t NeNe and could not truly know that.</p><p>All that’s clear is that she just walked away when her former friend appeared so she definitely did not want to have a back and forth with her at the time.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Kandi admitted that everyone was upset about it since there were many other things to discuss.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblrultYybrKuqpajAbr%2FHmqmeq12ptaZ50Z6YrKeeYsSpxYynnKedXaGyorfErGSbmZmhsqV5zqdkraCVYsOqvtOumKVloprCr7XOp2RtaGBtgXN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-baltierra-confirms-split-we-are-divorced.html><span>←</span><span>Tyler Baltierra Confirms Split: 'We Are Divorced'</span></a>
