Thanks to its earworm melody and sassy lyrics, plus Sabrina’s iconic performance at Coachella, ‘Espresso’ rightfully claims its spot at the top of the UK Singles Chart this week.</p><p>Sabrina knocked off Hozier from the top spot and faced a tough chart battle this week with her ex-tour mate Taylor Swift. Less than 500 units separated ‘Espresso’ from ‘fortnight’ featuring Post Malone, but ‘Espresso’ was victorious, also becoming the UK’s most-streamed track of the week, notching up 8.8 million streams, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Official Charts Company data</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>‘Espresso’ is proving to be Sabrina’s most successful single to date both in the UK and globally. Undoubtedly the song of the summer ahead, the track is simply irresistible and ticks all the right boxes. With addictive lyrics including “I’m working late, cos I’m a singer”, fellow popstars from across the world have been sharing their videos on TikTok, with the likes of Katy Perry, <a href=#>Perrie</a>, Tate McRae, FLETCHER and Ava Max lip syncing to the song.</p><p>Sabrina’s trajectory to becoming pop’s newest IT girl has been joyful to watch, especially over the past year or so. With singles including ‘Nonsense’ and ‘Feather’ garnering critical acclaim, Sabrina truly is the moment and is the all-round popstar that we need in 2024.</p><p>Continuing her world domination, Sabrina has been announced as the musical performer on SNL on May 18, alongside guest host Jake Gyllenhaal.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Are you as hooked on ‘Espresso’ as we are?
