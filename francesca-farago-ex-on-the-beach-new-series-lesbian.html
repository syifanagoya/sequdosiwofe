who had a whirlwind romance with The Only Way Is Essex star Demi Sims this year - will be part of the first lesbian couple on the show.</p><p>It comes after Love Island bosses ruled out the possibility of the ITV2 including gay contestants due to "logistical difficulties".</p><p>Ex On The Beach will see celebrities and their former flames jetting off to South America in a "ramped up" new series soon to hit screens.</p><p>Former stars have included Geordie Shore's Gaz Beadle, Charlotte Crosby and Marnie Simpson, as well as Towie's Megan McKenna and Joey Essex.</p><p>It's been hinted that Francesca will take centre stage of the new series after she found fame on Too Hot To Handle alongside ex-boyfriend Harry Jowsey.</p><p>Since then, the reality star hit the headlines thanks to her relationship with Towie favourite Demi, 25, and their subsequent messy split.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>It's thought that both Harry and Demi could potentially appear on the show alongside her, the <a href=#>Mail Online</a> have reported.</p><p>Francesca and Demi split in May and the star revealed they were "not on good terms" following their breakup -
